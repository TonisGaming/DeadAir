# This mod and any other The Long Dark mod made by me (TonisGaming) has been discontinued

# Dead Air
The chemical contamination from the Langston Mine has in some inconceivable way managed to spread across the entirety of Great Bear, now nowhere is safe from burnt lungs and filtered air. Use your time wisely and don't underestimate your amount of quality air. ***IT IS HIGHLY SUGGESTED TO ONLY USE THIS ON NEW SAVES***

## Why does this exist? 
Mainly I made this as a mod for myself, as I am a huge Metro fan and the gas mask gameplay is something I have always loved. Playing the game on Ranger Hardcore (The only intended way) the need to monitor, that you have enough filters when entering a zone and the thrill of scavenging for more filters when you're close to running out is just great. After seeing that Hinterland is planning on adding it, I was already thinking of making this, and after playing with it in ZoC, I decided it's in a good enough state to try to make this into a "fully fledged mod".


Something to take into account, this will probably stay in a "beta" state for a while, as this is quite experimental for TLD I feel, and I'm honestly surprised I even got it to function as much as I did. I will keep maintaining this and improving on it, as much as I can, with the hope of getting a nice 1.0 future in the future.

## **IMPORTANT** 
The filters drain in **REAL TIME**, so sleeping and advancing time will not get you killed. This is a Hinterland thing and without it, the mod wouldn't be very fun.
## Changelog

**BETA 1**


* Added the risk of chemical contamination everywhere on Great Bear, some places better, others worse. (Currently, outside is 10 minutes, inside is 20 minutes, prepper bunkers should be completely safe and the Cinder Hills Mine is 75 seconds. The Cinder Hills contamination is to test and see how having locations with specific dangers could work.)
* You now spawn with a respirator, 2 canisters and an improvised filter
* Added the ability to create an improvised filter. (Currently it is half as good as the normal canister)
* Added the ability to refill the canister and improvised filter (If you have Canister Refill installed, remove that)
* Added a settings menu. Currently only option is to disable or enable the mods functionality.

## *Known Issues*

* Sometimes the masks filter doesn't drain. Seems to happen when switching back and forth between scenes
* The improvised filter sometimes just says, you know what, I'm not a filter anymore. This seems to happen randomly?
* The ingame developer console gets spammed, no clue what it means, but it doesn't seem to break anything, just annoying

As always, if you find any bugs or have ideas, let me know. This will probably be an absolute bug fest and I'll be amazed if I ever manage to "finish" it
